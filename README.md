# libft - Your Very First Own Library

The "libft" project is a C library containing a collection of essential functions, replicating some standard C library functions with the 'ft_' prefix ('ft' stands for forty-two). It also includes additional utility functions and a bonus section for linked list manipulation.

## Project Highlights

- Replicate libc functions with your own implementations.
- Create new utility functions to enhance your library.
- Create linked list manipulation functions.
- Use a Makefile for easy compilation and library creation.

This project serves as a foundational tool for your programming curriculum, helping you improve your C programming skills and build a valuable resource for future projects.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the library using the provided Makefile.
3. Include the `libft.h` header in your C projects.
4. Use the `libft.a` library in your projects.
5. Use this command to test it with a test main.c `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. -lft`
